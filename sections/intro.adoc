== The different types of... Types in Scala

This blog post came into being after a few discussions about Types in Scala after some of JavaOne's parties in 2013. After those discussions I figured that many questions are often repeated by different people, during their learning of Scala. I though that we didn't have a full list of all tricks what we can to with Types in Scala, so I decided to write such a list - giving real life examples why we'd need these types.
