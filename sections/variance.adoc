== Type Variance in Scala

In Scala container types are **NOT variant at all by default**!

This means that for a container `List[Fruit]` you cannot insert Apples into it,
even if an `class Apple extends Fruit`.

Variance in Scala is defined by using `+` and `-` signs in front of type parameters.

| Name          | Description                        | Scala Syntax
| Invariant     | C[T'] and C[T] are **not** related | C[T]
| Covariant     | C[T'] is a subclass of [T]         | C[+T]
| Contravariant | C[T] is a subclass of C[T']        | C[-T]

There are (at least) two nice and very intuitive examples of this in Scala. One being "any collection", where we'll use a `List[A]
` as our example, and functions. A `List` is defined as `List[+A]` in Scala, so the below code is valid:

```
class Human
class Coder extends Human


```
