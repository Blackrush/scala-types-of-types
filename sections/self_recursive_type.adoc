== Self-Recursive Type

This we brought up with <a href="http://andrzejgrzesik.info">Andrzej Grzesik</a>, while discussing my blog post series about various Type Systems (my favourite topic :-)). Andrzej followed up <a href="http://andrzejgrzesik.info/2013/09/29/container-types/">on his blog, by explaining how the self-recursive generic type trick works in Java's Enum class</a>. Another nice blog post about this type-trick, is <a href="http://blog.jooq.org/2013/06/28/the-dangers-of-correlating-subtype-polymorphism-with-generic-polymorphism/">The dangers of correlating subtype polymorphism with generic polymorphism</a>, where lukaseder points out why/where this pattern may cause you trouble.

```scala
class Apple
